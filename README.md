# Photos-to-GIF ü§∫
A simple project to make a colletion of images into a GIF using python! 

Here I used three images from my favorite anime and turned them into a GIF. 

You need to install the `imagio` package, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip3 install imagio
```
If you don't have python version 3, then try this command:

```python
pip install imagio
```

Once the package is installed, you can use it in your Python code to create a GIF from a collection of images!

**Note:** This code assumes that you have the images (`pic1.jpeg`, `pic2.jpeg`, `pic3.jpeg`) in the same directory as your Python project. Adjust the file paths accordingly if your images are located elsewhere.

Remember to replace `'pic1.jpeg`, `'pic2.jpeg'`, and `'pic3.jpeg'` with the actual file paths of your images.

Hope this helps! ü§ç
